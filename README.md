# Final-Project

This project highlights neural spike train data to predict behavioral outcomes based on neural patterns and stimulus conditions.

During this process I explore many options to help assist me in the journey of finding the best fitting model. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to help bring this project to life.

This project includes training models like logistic regression model to help with (1 and -1) meaning success or failure.

Thank You
